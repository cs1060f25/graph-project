Project Name: Graphene

Description: There is a lot of tribal knowledge concerning finding the best research papers: hundreds are submitted each day, many of which are garbage.

## Development: start both client and server

You can start both the backend API server and the React client from the repository root using a single command.

1. Install dependencies from the root:
```bash
npm install
```
On Windows (or manually on Linux/MacOS),
```powershell
cd client
npm install

cd graph-project-react-app
npm install

cd ../../server
npm install
```

2. Start both services from the root:

```bash
npm start
```
